# Big_Data_Final_Project

# Introduction
Chronic health conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, High Cholesterol, and Heart Disease etc are on the rise globally, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare systems. Managing these conditions requires consistent monitoring of diet, medication, and access to real-time medical updates.

ChronicCare.AI is an AI-powered, patient-centric health management system that empowers individuals with chronic conditions to take control of their health. By integrating structured nutrition and medication data, unstructured health literature (PDFs, articles), location-based services, and AI-driven insights from large language models, the platform offers a unified experience for dietary guidance, medication adherence, and real-time medication updates.

# Objective:
The goal of ChronicCare.AI is to design an intelligent assistant that supports end-to-end chronic disease management, leveraging structured data, unstructured documents, and AI agents.
Key Objectives:
* To build a nutritionist module that provides daily caloric needs and food recommendations based on chronic conditions, with alerting systems for threshold violations through email.
* To develop a knowledge base powered by vector search Pinecone for patient-facing FAQs from research papers, PDFs, and government health guidelines.
* To integrate with location-aware web agents for discovering hospitals, clinics, and support groups nearby.
* To deliver real-time news, discoveries, and research updates for each condition via web search and summarization.

## üîç PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Scope
- Development of a data ingestion system to collect structured data (e.g., user inputs, food logs) and unstructured data (e.g., health articles, PDFs, web pages)
- Creation of an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to process nutrition data, medical knowledge bases, and live web content
- Implementation of four AI-powered agents:
  - **Nutrition Agent** ‚Äì provides dietary advice based on user inputs and chronic condition guidelines
  - **Knowledge-Based Agent** ‚Äì answers questions using curated healthcare documents and research
  - **Location Web Agent** ‚Äì finds nearby facilities like clinics, pharmacies, and support groups using Google Maps API
  - **Live Summary Agent** ‚Äì summarizes real-time web content for chronic health updates and trends
- Integration with OpenAI and LangGraph for agent orchestration and intelligent LLM responses
- Design and development of a Streamlit-based user interface for query input, visualization, and agent interaction
- Deployment of a FastAPI backend to coordinate agent tasks, manage state, and support scalable API access

### Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Individuals managing chronic conditions seeking personalized dietary, lifestyle, and location-based healthcare support  
- **Healthcare Providers**: Indirect beneficiaries who can integrate AI-driven insights into patient care plans  
- **Health Data Platforms**: Sources of medical research, condition guidelines, and nutrition databases powering the knowledge-based agent  
- **Local Health Services**: Clinics, pharmacies, and support groups that are surfaced through the Location Web Agent

---

## üöß PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing chronic illnesses is a complex and often overwhelming task. Patients must juggle multiple variables such as diet restrictions, medication schedules, etc.

Despite the abundance of medical knowledge and digital health tools, there is no centralized system that:
- Provides personalized nutrition, medication, and lifestyle guidance based on the user's condition
- Integrates real-time health insights with condition-specific recommendations
- Supports proactive alerts, and community/hospital discovery

The lack of personalization, integration, and proactive support leads to non-adherence, misinformation, and worsening health outcomes.


## üß± SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
ChronicCare.AI is an AI-powered assistant that integrates structured and unstructured data sources, LLM-powered agents, and a modular orchestration architecture using Airflow and LangGraph.

### Frontend (Streamlit UI)
- User Input: Chronic condition + location
- Tabs:
  - Nutrition Tracker: Recommends and monitors daily intake
  - Condition KB: QA on uploaded PDFs about the condition
  - Nearby Clinics & Support: Based on user location
  - Health Summary: Personalized recommendations and alerts
- Output:
  - Daily nutrient recommendations with intake tracking
  - Top 5 nearby clinics, pharmacies, and support groups
  - Summary with alert flags (limit crossed)
  - Email-based reminders and risk alerts

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Receives query, chronic condition, and location from UI
- Routes via LangGraph controller to appropriate agent:
  - Nutrition Agent
  - Knowledge Base QA Agent
  - Location Web Agent
  - Summary & Alert Agent

### Agents (LangGraph)
- **Nutrition Agent**: Uses Snowflake data ingested from Edamam API to suggest caloric & nutrient intake
- **Knowledge Base QA Agent**: Answers questions using PDFs via Mistral, OpenAI, Pinecone (RAG pipeline)
- **Location Web Agent**: Uses Google Maps API and OpenAI API to fetch nearby healthcare services
- **Summary Agent**: Aggregates user data and sends health summaries and alerts

### Pipeline Orchestration: Apache Airflow
- **Structured Data**:
  - Ingested from Edamam API
  - Stored in Snowflake
- **Unstructured Data**:
  - PDFs uploaded to S3 ‚Üí Converted via MistralAI ‚Üí Embedded and stored in Pinecone
- **Live Data**:
  - Tavily API for real-time web search (news, clinic data)

### Datasets Used
- Structured: EDAMAM (via ETL, Snowflake)
- Unstructured: PDFs
- Live: Tavily API (for web results)
